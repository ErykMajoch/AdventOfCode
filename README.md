# Advent Of Code
What better way to practise programming than doing all of the AoC challenges?

For each day, I will choose a random language to complete the challenges in. Here are the languages that:
1. I already know and want to test my knowledge
2. I have very little experience with and want to familiarise myself more
3. Have absolutely no experience with and want to try just for fun

The python script `random_language.py` will choose the language for me.
